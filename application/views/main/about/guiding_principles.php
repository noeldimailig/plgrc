                    <h4>Institutional Development</h4>
                    <p>Oriental Mindoro PLGRC is a distinctive institutional network made
                        up of independent and interdependent MSAC member organizations. As an
                        institution, it must develop and evolve in line with the demands of its
                        MSAC members as well as the current market trends. Its growth shall be
                        based on the common interest of all member organizations to advance
                        through proactive policy issuances on its operations, management, and
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>The Provincial Order organizing the Oriental Mindoro PLGRC shall be
                        updated based on the demands of the center. There shall also be capacity
                        development activities supportive of strengthening Knowledge
                        Management. The expansion of membership of the PLGRC and the MSAC
                        shall also be constantly reviewed to sustain its operations and deliver its
                        services.</p>
                    <p>Towards this, the personnel and staff of Oriental Mindoro PLGRC
                        shall continuously enhance their capacities through capacity enhancement
                        activities provided by the LGA and the LGRRC MIMAROPA. It can also
                        engage in inter-PLGRC programs and activities to enhance and improve its
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>To enhance knowledge sharing and eliminate knowledge loss,
                        provincial policies shall be issued from time to time supporting the
                        institutionalization of Knowledge Management. Knowledge transfer and
                        sharing can be done during provincial activities such as Provincial Team
                        Conferences, Team Buildings, Cluster Conferences and meetings, and
                        other informal conferences.</p>
                    <p>The Oriental Mindoro PLGRC shall also adopt its own Business Plan
                        (BP) anchored on the needs of the center identified under the different capacity pillars. There will also be periodical assessment of the BP to
                        measure the achievement of the PLGRC based on its established roadmap.</p>

                    <h4>Partnership and Collaboration</h4>
                    <p>In recognition that the PLGRC holds no monopoly of knowledge in
                        the province, the Center aims to assist partner organizations and clients
                        by connecting them to appropriate organizations/agencies with the
                        capacity or mandate to help them. This can be in the form of pooling of
                        resources, tapping of subject matter experts and provision of technical
                        assistance, among others. The PLGRC serves as a broker by linking the
                        needs of its clients to the resources that are appropriate and necessary to
                        address their demands and needs.</p>
                    <p>Collaborations within the MSAC are deeply anchored on mutual
                        interests of member institutions and organizations to further excellence in
                        local governance in the province. The sharing of resources both logistical
                        and financial shall be based on the capacity of partnering MSAC members
                        to sustain collaborative programs, projects and activities.</p>

                    <h4>Resource Mobilization</h4>
                    <p>A significant aspect of the Oriental Mindoro PLGRC is resource
                        mobilization to be able to support and sustain its operations. Resources
                        can be in the form of financial resources and other logistical contributions
                        such as manpower hours, supplies, equipment, venue, and others. In
                        consideration of this, the Oriental Mindoro PLGRC may also adopt resource
                        generation strategies which includes seeking of grants, donations,
                        cost-sharing schemes or counterparting with partners, and developing
                        resource generating projects and activities. These strategies however
                        should exclude loans and other forms of indebtedness. These strategies
                        shall be incorporated in the business plan of Oriental Mindoro PLGRC.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Knowledge Sharing Mechanism</h4>
                    <p>The PLGRC operates on the principle of Knowledge Management
                        (KM) whose essential feature is the sharing of knowledge to the public.
                        Knowledge dissemination and sharing as an intermediate step in the KM
                        process endeavors public education and citizen empowerment.</p>
                    <p>Utilizing the strengths and capacities of the PLGRC facilities, the
                        center proceeds with the process of identification, creation and application
                        of knowledge that is tailor-fitted for its target clients. On this precept, and
                        in order to maintain the quality of information while being shared within
                        the organization, the following strategies shall be employed:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There should be proper documentation of knowledge identified,
                            created and applied.</li>
                        <li>Sharing of the database for all knowledge being managed;</li>
                        <li>There should be constant coordination between the PLGRC facilities

                    </ol>

                    <p>The following strategies should be used to widen the audience and
