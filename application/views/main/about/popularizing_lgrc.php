                    <h1 class="card-title">POPULARIZING THE PLGRC</h1>
                    <p>PLGRC is essentially a network or partnership of knowledge centers
                        catering to a broad clientele. Both the clients and the collaborators (or
                        future partners) must be made aware of PLGRC through promotion or
                        marketing.</p>
                    <p>Clients of the PLGRC will include persons and organizations of all
                        ages, including those in school, working professionals, and groups with a
                        range of sectoral affiliations. Predominantly, clients of the center will come
                        from the local government sector and other offices involved in governance
                        and administration. Any individual or organization that requires knowledge
                        and/or expertise, particularly with regard to the governance field, may
                        seek assistance from the PLGRC. Together with its partners in the
                        knowledge market, PLGRC shall serve these clients.</p>
                    <p>In terms of partners and collaborators, the PLGRC will keep
                        exploring potential new centers for partnerships through network mapping
                        or other methods. By holding frequent meetings and engaging in
                        cooperative activities, it will also continue to strengthen and enhance its
                        current partners.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Client Management</h4>
                    <p>Through ICT (websites), immersions, advertising/IEC campaigns,
                        consulting visits, letters of invitation/offerings, partnerships with media,
                        and referral systems from current partners, clients can be reached.</p>
                    <p>Clients who need assistance shall be evaluated based on the
                        capacity of the PLGRC to provide the required support based on available
                        resources. If the client requirements can be addressed effectively by
                        member organizations, the client will be referred accordingly. The PLGRC
                        shall also evaluate how service is delivered to clients through feedback
                        mechanisms and tools.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Partnership Management</h4>
                    <p>Collaborators can be reached through communication, social
                        networks and e-groups, advocacy, and provision of support for knowledge
                        products development.</p>
                    <p>Once collaborators are on board, they can sign contracts or MOA/U,
                        engage in fora, round table conversations, and focused group discussions,
                        or even organize these activities together. Moreover, they can implement
                        convergent programs, thereby combining resources and skills. A list of
                        partners will be kept up to date by the PLGRC.</p>

                    <h4>Marketing Strategy</h4>
                    <p>The marketing plan aims to raise awareness among local governance
                        stakeholders and customers about the PLGRC's presence and key services.</p>
                    <p>To spread awareness about the PLGRC throughout the province, the
                        following marketing strategies shall be adopted:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Quad-Media involvement.</span> This includes preparing and distributing press releases and announcements about PLGRC
                            projects, programs, and activities to print, radio, and television
                            networks. This also entails publishing press releases and
                            announcements on the PLGRC social media accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Engagement in advocacy.</span>
                            Attending meetings of various local leagues, professional organizations, subcommittee meetings, among others, is one way advocacy efforts are carried out to address the PLGRC services, programs, initiatives, and activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Office-maintained Systems (OMS).</span> The many programs and services offered by the center will be published on a specific PLGRC office-maintained system. Additionally, it will host the PLGRC e-library and publish the knowledge products found in the center.
                            The PLGRC OMS shall be linked to the websites and systems of
                            interested partners via proper legal means.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Social Media.</span> Using social media, Facebook, is another way to advertise PLGRC services. The DILG shall build and maintain a Facebook page that is accessible to the public and used by the
                            majority of DILG employees.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fw-bold">Promotional Material.</span> The Multimedia and information facility will create marketing materials, such as flyers and brochures, to further promote the PLGRC. The same would be distributed to the clients and PLGRC partners. Copies will likewise be retained at the PLGRC.
