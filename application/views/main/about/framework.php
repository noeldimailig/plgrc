                    <p>The MIMAROPA LGRC is basically established to help LGUs achieve
                        excellence in local governance through key principles of knowledge
                        management, convergence, and multi-stakeholdership. The KM Framework
                        illustrates that the MIMAROPA LGRC is a platform that provides the right capacity
                        development (CapDev) for the right LGU from the right CapDev provider, while
                        ensuring that it delivers the Departmentâ€™s mandate of performance oversight
                        and the provision of awards and incentives.</p>
                    <p>The LGRC-MIMAROPA strives to achieve its vision, mission, and goals by
                        implementing different strategies. One of which is the ISO certification of the
                        management system, which ensures timeliness and accuracy in the delivery of
                        services to our clients. Another strategy is the establishment of the PLGRCs in
                        the different island provinces of the MIMAROPA Region to help with geographical
                        issues. LGRC-MIMAROPA also implements a cluster approach wherein strategic
                        cluster teams complement the sub-regionalization strategy to efficiently and
                        effectively deliver the services of LGRC-MIMAROPA. Result-Based Monitoring and
                        Evaluation (RBME) and a feedback mechanism are integrated into those
                        strategies to ensure that LGRC-MIMAROPA has what is required and is within the
                        client's expectations.</p>
